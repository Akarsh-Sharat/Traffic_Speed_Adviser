# CitySpeed Advisor

CitySpeed Advisor is a real-time vehicle speed control system that utilizes traffic signal information to improve traffic flow and reduce wait time for drivers. This project aims to enhance road safety, increase traffic management efficiency, and improve the overall driver experience in a smart city environment.

## Features

- Real-time information on traffic signal positions and their current status.
- Advises drivers on the optimal speed to avoid stopping at red lights.
- Improved road safety by reducing instances of drivers running red lights.
- Increased efficiency in traffic management and reduced congestion in cities.
- Enhanced driver experience in a smart city environment.
